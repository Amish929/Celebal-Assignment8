Task: Apply pre and post-deployment approvers in the release pipeline.

✅ Step 1: Create an Environment with Approvers
Go to Pipelines → Environments

Click “New environment”

Give it a name like dev or prod

After creating, click the environment

Click “…” (More options) → Approvals and checks

Click + Add check → Choose Approvals

Add your Azure DevOps user (or mentor) as an approver

Save it ✅

✅ Step 2: Update Your YAML Pipeline to Use the Environment
Here’s an example YAML file that uses that environment:

 trigger:
- main

stages:
- stage: Deploy
  displayName: "Deploy to Environment"
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployJob
    displayName: "Deployment Job"
    environment: dev  # 🔴 This is where approvals are triggered
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: echo "Deploying application..."


The environment: dev part triggers the approval before running the job — only after approval, the DeployJob will run.

✅ How It Works
| Step                                | What Happens                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Pipeline reaches `environment: dev` | Pauses and waits for approval |
| Approver clicks Approve in UI   | Pipeline continues            |
| Approver clicks Reject          | Pipeline fails the stage      |
